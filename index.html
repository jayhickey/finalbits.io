    <h3 id="hi-im-jay">Hi, I'm Jay 👋</h3>
    <p>I started out shipping apps independently just for fun. Since then, I’ve led product engineering at Limitless (formerly Rewind AI), where we built the Limitless Pendant—an AI-powered wearable—and at Meta (Facebook), where I led development of the Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses companion app. Earlier, I worked on self-driving technology at Uber ATG and released several featured iOS apps on my own.</p>
  
    <p>Having built across mobile, cloud, hardware, and AI, I bring an end-to-end perspective shaped by both startup scrappiness and large-scale systems work. My experience spans from building 0→1 MVPs to scaling products for millions of users. I offer:</p>
  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technical Expertise</strong> – I can set technical direction, design scalable architecture, and help your team ship complex features with confidence.</li>
      <li><strong>Product Feedback</strong> – I can help scope features, assess tradeoffs, and provide actionable input to keep teams focused on what matters most.</li>
      <li><strong>Hiring</strong> – I can assist with technical interviews or recruiting strategy to help you find and evaluate strong engineering talent.</li>
      <li><strong>Mentorship</strong> – I can coach engineers and founders to grow into effective technical leaders.</li>
      <li><strong>Fractional CTO</strong> – I can offer strategic technical leadership and long-term vision for early-stage startups before a full-time CTO hire.</li>
    </ul>
