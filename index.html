    <h3 id="hi-im-jay">Hi, I'm Jay 👋</h3>
    <p>I got my start by shipping apps independently just for fun. Since then, I've led product engineering teams at Limitless (formerly Rewind AI), where we built the Limitless Pendant, an AI-powered wearable, and at Facebook, where I led development of the Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses companion app. I also helped build self-driving software at Uber ATG and released several featured iOS apps on my own.</p>

    <p>I bring experience from both sides: building 0→1 MVPs and scaling complex systems that power millions of users. Having worked across the full stack in mobile, cloud, firmware, and AI, I bring an end-to-end perspective to every engagement.</p>

    <p>Whether you're validating a new idea or scaling production systems, I can help you architect, ship, and lead with clarity.</p>

    <h4>Services</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Technical Expertise</strong> — I can set technical direction, design scalable architecture, or help your team ship whatever ambitious features you're building next.</li>
      <li><strong>Product Feedback</strong> — I can scope features, evaluate tradeoffs, and provide actionable feedback to help you move faster and stay focused on what matters most.</li>
      <li><strong>Hiring</strong> — I can conduct technical interviews or advise on recruiting to help you find and evaluate great engineers.</li>
      <li><strong>Mentorship</strong> — I can provide mentorship for engineers or founders, helping them grow into stronger technical leaders.</li>
      <li><strong>Fractional CTO</strong> — I can provide leadership-level guidance and technical vision for early-stage startups before a full-time CTO hire.</li>
    </ul>
