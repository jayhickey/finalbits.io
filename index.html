    <h3 id="hi-im-jay">Hi, I'm Jay 👋</h3>
    <p>I started out building apps on my own just for fun. I'm currently CTO at Limitless (formerly Rewind AI), leading development of the Limitless Pendant, an AI-powered wearable. Before that, I was Head of Engineering at Rewind AI, and I led the iOS team for the Ray-Ban Stories smartglasses at Facebook, serving as a lead engineer on the first large Swift-based app at the company. Earlier, I worked on self-driving technology at Uber ATG and released several featured apps independently.</p>
    <p>Across these roles, I've focused on building strong engineering teams, shipping ambitious products, and solving problems at the intersection of hardware, software, and AI.</p>
    <p>Final Bits is where I work with founders and engineering teams who want an outside perspective. I focus on clear thinking around architecture, product direction, and early technical decisions, drawing on experience from both startup environments and large-scale systems.</p>
    <p>Areas I often help with:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Technical direction</strong>: Guidance on scalability, reliability, and long-term architecture.</li>
    <li><strong>Product insight</strong>: Developing product mindset, prioritization, and execution strategy.</li>
    <li><strong>Team building</strong>: Supporting hiring, leveling, team structure, and leadership growth.</li>
    </ul>
