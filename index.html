    <h3 id="hi-im-jay">Hi, I'm Jay 👋</h3>
    <p>I started out building apps on my own just for fun. I am currently CTO at Limitless (formerly Rewind AI), leading development the Limitless Pendant, an AI-powered wearable. Before that, I was Head of Engineering at Rewind AI and I led the iOS team for the Ray-Ban Stories smartglasses at Facebook, serving as a lead engineer on the first Swift-based app at the company. Earlier, I worked on self-driving technology at Uber ATG and released several featured apps independently.</p>
    <p>I enjoy helping teams move faster and make better technical decisions. I occasionally advise founders, mentor engineers, and share lessons learned from building and scaling products across hardware, mobile, and AI.</p>
    <p>Areas I often help with:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Technical Expertise</strong>: Guiding design choices for scalability and performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Product feedback</strong>: Helping teams prioritize, prototype, and iterate efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Hiring & Development</strong>: Supporting engineering growth and leadership development.</li>
    </ul>
